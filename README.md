## Problem Statement :
   AtliQ hardware is a company which delivers computer hardware & peripheral Manufacturers to his clients, which has several branches in different countries. The sales director of the company is facing a lot of issues in terms of understanding how the business is performing and what are all the problem company is facing currently as the sales are not as expected and declining gradually in some regions . And whenever he calls the regional managers to get the current status of the sales and market, as a human behaviour, these people sugar cote the truth and send tons of Excel files instead of disclosing the truth, which made the sales director more frustrated. Humans are not comfortable in consuming numbers from excel files, which is obvious reason for the frustration.

## Problem Solution :
   Sales director of the AltiQ hardware, decided to build a PowerBI Dashboard for converting the data into visual representation to make data driven decisions. So, he hired a team of data people to complete this task.

## Pipeline of the project :
   1. Extracted the data from Excel workbook to power Bi.
   2. Did Data transformation, validation and quality check in power query.
   3. Created measure for needs and used them for creating visuals in PowerBi.
   4. After the initial report reviewed by the stakeholders, made changes to the report based on the review & requirements.
